## Data Generation

Mock data is automatically generated on first run. To regenerate:

```bash
java -cp target/savora-finance-1.0.0.jar com.savora.util.MockDataGenerator
```

This will populate 10 years of data for all 5 stocks (~13,000 data points).

## Technical Details

### Database Tables
- `stock_symbols` - Stock ticker and name
- `market_data` - Historical OHLC data
- `simulated_accounts` - Trading account balance
- `positions` - Current holdings
- `orders` - Order book
- `trades` - Executed trade history

### Order Execution Logic
```
MARKET BUY:  Price = Open + Slippage
MARKET SELL: Price = Open - Slippage

LIMIT BUY:   Price = Limit (if Low ‚â§ Limit)
LIMIT SELL:  Price = Limit (if High ‚â• Limit)

Commission = max(Amount √ó 0.1%, $1.00)
```

### Position Calculation
```
Avg Cost = (Old Cost √ó Old Qty + New Price √ó New Qty) / Total Qty
Unrealized P&L = (Current Price - Avg Cost) √ó Quantity
P&L % = (Unrealized P&L / Cost Basis) √ó 100
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have enough cash/shares

**Q: Can't sell a stock?**
